# Maintain a head and a tail pointer on the merged linked list. 
# Then choose the head of the merged linked list by comparing 
# the first node of both linked lists. For all subsequent nodes in both lists, 
# you choose the smaller current node and link it to the tail of the merged list, 
# and moving the current pointer of that list one step forward.

# Continue this while there are some remaining elements in both the lists. 
# If there are still some elements in only one of the lists, 
# you link this remaining list to the tail of the merged list. 
# Initially, the merged linked list is NULL.

# Compare the value of the first two nodes and make the node 
# with the smaller value the head node of the merged linked list. 
# In this example, it is 4 from head1. 
# Since itâ€™s the first and only node in the merged list, it will also be the tail. 
# Then move head1 one step forward.
