# Scan the whole array once and store visited elements in a hash set.
# During scan, for every element e in the array, we check if val - e is present in the hash set i.e. val - e is already visited.
# If val - e is found in the hash set, it means there is a pair (e, val - e) in array whose sum is equal to the given val.
# If we have exhausted all elements in the array and didnâ€™t find any such pair, the function will return false
