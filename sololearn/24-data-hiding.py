# Weakly private methods and attributes have a single 
# underscore at the beginning.
# This signals that they are private, 
# and shouldn't be used by external code. 
# However, it is mostly only a convention, 
# and does not stop external code from accessing them.

# Strongly private methods and attributes 
# have a double underscore at the beginning of their names. 
# This causes their names to be mangled, which means 
# that they can't be accessed from outside the class. 
# The purpose of this isn't to ensure that they are kept private, 
# but to avoid bugs if there are subclasses 
# that have methods or attributes with the same names.
# Name mangled methods can still be accessed externally, 
# but by a different name. 
# The method __privatemethod of class Spam 
# could be accessed externally with _Spam__privatemethod.
